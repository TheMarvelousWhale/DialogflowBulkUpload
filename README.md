# DialogflowBulkUpload

This is the automation files for creating a specific type of intents (one parent with two children intents) for the NTU Dialogflow Chatbot.

Most files are boilerplate files and ceaned info files from the University staff, while the main workhorse is big.py

Please do note that in the Lyon-Template folder there are two files that deserve a bit more attention: agent.js and package.json. Please do use the newest version for these two files otherwise the behaviours of the bot will be suspicious as well.
